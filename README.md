# Gleanify

## Getting Started
GLEANIFY aims to connect farmers with various buyers, including bio-waste processors, gleaning organizations, and livestock feed producers, to transform agricultural waste into valuable products like energy, fertilizer, and livestock feed. This platform offers multiple benefits: income diversification for farmers, reduced environmental waste, and a stronger agricultural economy in Cebu. By creating a robust waste marketplace, GLEANIFY not only helps farmers monetize their waste but also contributes to a cleaner environment and a more sustainable agricultural sector.
